# soccerDemo
Welcome to the final repository for our project for UC San Diego's [Data Science Student Society's](https://ds3.ucsd.edu/) Winter 2022 Cohort.

### Repository Files
In this repository, you can find the main demo file under "streamlit_app.py".

If you look in this repo's sub-folders, you will find all of the data files we used for the demo and the modeling under "Data" (the primary data files were too large and were stored on Google Drive), the image we used to describe StatsBomb's coordinate system under "Assets", a few of the (many) notebooks we used for EDA and fixing some of our data frames as well as our two modeling notebooks under "Notebooks", and the different pages of the demo under "Pages".

Some of our earlier work with data cleaning can be found in a different repository. [Click Here](https://github.com/arnavkhanna/soccerAnalysis) to check out that work.

### Demo - Cloud Version
The cloud version of the demo can be found [here](https://share.streamlit.io/gprasad125/soccerdemo/main).\
This is currently not working, but we'll post an update here if we get it to work.
