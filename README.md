# soccerDemo
Welcome to the final repository for our project for UC San Diego's Data Science Student Society's Winter 2022 Cohort.

### Repository Files
In this repository, you can find the main demo file under "streamlit_app.py".

If you look in this repo's sub-folders, you will find all of the data files we used under "Data", the image we used to describe StatsBomb's coordinate system under "Assets", a few of the (many) notebooks we used for EDA and fixing some of our data frames as well as our two modeling notebooks under "Notebooks", and the different pages of the demo under "Pages".

Please note that not all of our notebooks for exploratory data analysis are available in this repository - if you're interested in seeing these, let us know!
